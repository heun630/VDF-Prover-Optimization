# Pietrzak VDF Simulator
This project implements the Pietrzak Verifiable Delay Function([Simple Verifiable Delay Functions - Krzysztof Pietrzak](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf)),
utilizing cryptographic proofs to ensure data integrity and security for applications requiring verifiable sequential work with outputs that are easy to verify but hard to compute.
